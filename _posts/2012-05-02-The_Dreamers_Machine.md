####About
After song placements in film & TV like “Smallville", “ER”, “Side Order of Life”, “The Evidence”, and the Werner Herzog movie "Rescue Dawn" (starring Christian Bale and Steve Zahn), the release of James Carrington's debut album is a long time dream come true for him.   
  
Produced by Hollywood film composer Klaus Badelt (Pirates of the Caribbean), the album features legendary talents Michael Landau (Joni Mitchell/James Taylor), Luis Conte (Madonna), Tom Coster (Santana), Abe Laboriel (Stevie Wonder), Abe Laboriel Jr (Paul McCartney) and engineer/co-producer James Guthrie (Pink Floyd). The music was recorded in London, Paris and Los Angeles with strings at Abbey Road, London.
