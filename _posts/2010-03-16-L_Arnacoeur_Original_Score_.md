####About
This is my score to the French romantic comedy “L’Arnacoeur” (Heartbreaker). The music to the Vanessa Paradis-starrer features the London Metropolitan Orchestra tracked at Abbey Road London, teaming up with longtime collaborator Andrew Raiher's groovy guitars.  
  
I also co-wrote and produced a song specifically for the film which, sadly, I cannot offer here, as legalities disallow me using cool site features such as pick-your-price.  
  
This is also the launch release of labelzero.com, my artist and producer driven progressive digital outlet for soundtracks and up-and-coming recording artists.
