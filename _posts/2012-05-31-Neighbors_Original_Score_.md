####Credits
Have you ever been in a competition with a friend or neighbor? Well Timothy Longshanks has been for years. And now he's on a mission to win that competition no matter what the cost. But his unaware, gentle-giant of a neighbor, Big Al, always has what Tim just got, or better. A journey of one-upmanship ensues leading Tim to the far corners of the world and back again. His mania ultimately leads him down a path of no return ending in hilariously disastrous results.
