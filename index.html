        <h2><i class="fa fa-cloud-download"></i> Digital Download</h2>
        <p class="lead">Immediate download of audio files in MP3, AAC, FLAC, ALAC and Ogg Vorbis. Starting at $0.</p>
        <p>All digital stereo downloads are Name-Your-Price with no minimum. Pick a price you feel is fair - including free. Paying supporters get unlimited mobile access using the free listening app.</p>
        <p>Our online player features full-length previews - way beyond the usual 30-90 seconds others offer. Every track of an album can be previewed.</p>
        <p>The default download format is MP3, the most downloaded format. These files play back beautifully in iTunes, Windows Media Player, your iPhone/Android phone, etc. and include high quality cover art, accurate artist and track names, and lyrics when available. Our MP3s use variable bit-rate encoding (VBR) to shrink the size of the files while maintaining the highest quality, so you get fast downloads and can fit more labelzero.com soundtracks on your iPhone.</p>
        <p>If you have an older MP3 player that doesn't like VBR files, try the MP3 320 format instead. These files are larger but they sound just as good and have all the same metadata, and will work on any MP3 player.</p>
        <p>You can also download in FLAC, ALAC (Apple Lossless), AAC, or Ogg Vorbis format. These options provide higher quality. FLAC and ALAC feature lossless compression, meaning the audio information within is unchanged from the original masters down to the last bit - but they are also rather large files.</p>

We use the original masters to deliver lossless, high-resolution versions of every album. Mastered at 24bit, our Surround downloads deliver the exact sound the composer and filmmakers heard in the studio when these albums were recorded and mixed.

        <p>In addition to the regular DVD format, the disc includes the album in DVD-A surround for compatible audiohpile DVD-Audio players (16bit surround, maxing out the technical specs of DVD-A). The same disc also contains 24bit surround FLAC audio files of all tracks, to be opened and played on your computer with DVD drive. In total the multi-format disc contains 3 formats:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>DVD - playable on any DVD player</li>
          <li>DVD-A - playable on any DVD-Audio (DVD-A) player</li>

        <p class="lead">Lossless Compression: True High-Resolution Surround Audiophile Sound.</p>
        <p>Our Music Blu-ray is a music-only disc featuring audiophile sound quality and on On-Screen Menu display playable on every (modern) Blu-disc player.</p>
        <p>We use the original masters to deliver lossless, high-resolution versions of every album. Mastered at 24bit, labelzero.com's Blu-ray Discs deliver the sound the composer and filmmakers heard in the studio when these albums were recorded and mixed.</p>
        <p>We chose the highest standard as the audio file format for playback: DTS-HD Master Audio in Surround. This is the highest quality format available on Blu-ray, delivering lossless compression in Surround and 24bit for the audiophile listener. This is the same listening experience as in the mix studio.</p>
        <p>The On-Screen Menu display allows easy selection of titles with your remote. While playing back, the current title is shown on the display. You can also leave the display off for a focused audio-only surround experience - our Blu-ray discs play from start to end, and titles can be selected via your remote.</p>
        <p>The disc also contains all tracks as high resolution, lossless surround FLAC audio files. Since it comes in the AVCHD format - while authored in the Blu-ray standard, the physical media is actually DVD - it can also be put in your computer's DVD drive to access the data section with audio files. No computer Blu-ray drive needed, just a regular DVD drive works.</p>
        <p>A PDF booklet is also contained in the data section of the disc.</p>
