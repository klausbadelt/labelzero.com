        <h2><i class="fa fa-cloud-download"></i> Digital Download - Stereo</h2>
        <p class="lead">Immediate download of stereo audio files in MP3, AAC, FLAC, ALAC and Ogg Vorbis from $0.</p>
        <p>All digital stereo downloads are Name-Your-Price with no minimum. Pick a price you feel is fair - including free. Paying supporters get unlimited mobile access using the free listening app.</p>
        <p>The default download format is MP3, the most downloaded format. These files play back beautifully in iTunes, Windows Media Player, your iPhone/Android phone, etc. and include high quality cover art, accurate artist and track names, and lyrics when available. Our MP3s use variable bit-rate encoding (VBR) to shrink the size of the files while maintaining the highest quality, so you get fast downloads and can fit more labelzero.com soundtracks on your iPhone.</p>
        <p>If you have an older MP3 player that doesn't like VBR files, try the MP3 320 format instead. These files are larger but they sound just as good and have all the same metadata, and will work on any MP3 player.</p>
        <p>You can also download in FLAC, ALAC (Apple Lossless), AAC, or Ogg Vorbis format. These options provide higher quality. FLAC and ALAC feature lossless compression, meaning the audio information within is unchanged from the original masters down to the last bit - but they are also rather large files.</p>
