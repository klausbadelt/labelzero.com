        <h2><i class="fa fa-cloud-download"></i> Digital Download - Stereo</h2>
        <p class="lead">Immediate download of audio files in MP3, AAC, FLAC, ALAC and Ogg Vorbis from $0.</p>
        <p>All digital stereo downloads are Name-Your-Price with no minimum. Pick a price you feel is fair - including free. Paying supporters get unlimited mobile access using the free listening app.</p>
        <p>Our online player features full-length previews - way beyond the usual 30-90 seconds others offer. Every track of an album can be previewed.</p>
        <p>The default download format is MP3, the most downloaded format. These files play back beautifully in iTunes, Windows Media Player, your iPhone/Android phone, etc. and include high quality cover art, accurate artist and track names, and lyrics when available. Our MP3s use variable bit-rate encoding (VBR) to shrink the size of the files while maintaining the highest quality, so you get fast downloads and can fit more labelzero.com soundtracks on your iPhone.</p>
        <p>If you have an older MP3 player that doesn't like VBR files, try the MP3 320 format instead. These files are larger but they sound just as good and have all the same metadata, and will work on any MP3 player.</p>
        <p>You can also download in FLAC, ALAC (Apple Lossless), AAC, or Ogg Vorbis format. These options provide higher quality. FLAC and ALAC feature lossless compression, meaning the audio information within is unchanged from the original masters down to the last bit - but they are also rather large files.</p>

        <p>
We use the original masters to deliver lossless, high-resolution versions of every album. Mastered at 24bit, the label's Blu-Ray  Discs deliver the sound the composer and filmmakers heard in the studio when these albums were recorded and mixed.
We chose the highest standard as the audio file format for playback: DTS-HD Master Audio in (Note: 5.1 available where noted)
Your preferred audio format is chosen either by pressing the "Audio" button on your Blu-ray remote or via the On-Screen Menu Display</p>

        <p>We understand Audio CD is still preferred by many over downloads. <strong>Every</strong> album is therefore also released as physical Compact Disk.</p>
         <p>Our high-end mastering process includes Psychoacoustically Optimized Wordlength Reduction (Pow-r) and/or the Apogee UV22HR High Resolution Audio Encoding process, bringing the best possible sound to the Compact Disc format.</p>

        <p>Our Music Blu-ray is a music-only disc featuring audiophile sound quality and on On-Screen Menu display for easy selection of titles, playable on your Blu-disc player.</p>
        <p>We use the original masters to deliver lossless, high-resolution versions of every album. Mastered at 24bit, labelzero.com's Blu-ray Discs deliver the sound the composer and filmmakers heard in the studio when these albums were recorded and mixed.</p>
        <p>We chose the highest standard as the audio file format for playback: DTS-HD Master Audio in 5.1 Surround. Titles can be selected via an On-Screen Menu Display. While playing back, the current title is shown on the display. You can also leave the display off for a focused audio-only surround experience - our Blu-ray discs play from start to end, and titles can be selected via your remote.</p>
        <p>The disc also contains all tracks as high resolution, lossless surround FLAC audio files. Since it comes in the AVCHD format - while Blu-ray formatted, the physical media is actually a DVD disc, playing in all modern Blu-ray players - it can also be put in your computer's DVD drive to access the data section with audio files.

        <p>A PDF booklet is also contained in the data section of the disc.</p>
